## Requirement 
- A static HTTP server able to serve your site to your's users.
- A tool to upload on your server ([Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)) or similar)
- A text editor, with syntax highlight preferably ([notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or similar)

## Usefull 
A efficient way to build a website, is to build and test everything on a local server (let's say : on your own computer) and when everything work's, to upload on your distant server.  
for that you need a server on your computer to test your site locally (apache is great and come in easy to use packages ([Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)), but even the smaller server would be good enough).
